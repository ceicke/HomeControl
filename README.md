# HomeControl

AppleWatch App for Controlling your Loxone Miniserver.

This is a simple AppleWatch App for controlling the lighting of your Loxone Miniserver. Currently all UUIDs that are used in the Miniserver are hard coded for my specific setup at home. If you want to use it for your own Loxone setup, you will have to adapt the code.

Here is an action video of an early version: https://vimeo.com/141987821
